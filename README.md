## History

I made this program in April 2022, during the COVID-19 pandemic. To attend class it was necessary to navigate to the web form, fill out the required fields, and present the QR code COVID-19 badge to track COVID status. I found that this became an ardous task towards the end of the year so I designed this simple Selenium script with the goal of automating the process to make it easier and quicker to receive the COVID badge. 
## Status

The program will no longer work since the discontinuing of this required service. However the source code is within the repository for those interested.
