## Usage ##

I made this program in April 2022, during the COVID-19 pandemic. To attend class it was required to navigate to the web form, fill out the required fields, and present the QR code COVID-19 badge to track COVID status. I found that this became an arduous task to repeat so I designed this simple Selenium automation with the goal of making the process easier and quicker to receive the COVID badge. 

*The program will no longer work since this required service is discontinued. However, the source code is still available within the repository for those interested.*
